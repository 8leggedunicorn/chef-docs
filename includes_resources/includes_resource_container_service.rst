Use the |resource container_service| resource to configure a |runit| service inside a |linux| container. |runit| is the service used by |chef container| to run the applications inside a |linux| container. The |resource container_service| resource leverages the |resource service| resource. After the platform has been identified by the |chef client|, the |resource container_service| replaces the |resource service| resource's provider with a provider that is dedicated to containers, and then configures |runit| to manage that service.
