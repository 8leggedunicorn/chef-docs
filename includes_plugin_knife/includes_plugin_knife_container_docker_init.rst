The ``docker init`` argument is used to set up a |docker| context for the specified image on your local workstation. A |docker| context is a folder on your local workstation that contains a |dockerfile| and all the files and folders that are required in order to create the image. Only the files in the context are available to you when you are building your |docker| image.
