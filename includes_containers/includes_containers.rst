A |linux| container is an approach to virtualization that eliminates the need for a hypervisor by leveraging a feature of the |linux| kernel called control groups. Control groups allow a |linux| operating system to isolate CPU, memory, network, file system volumes and process into a userspace commonly referred to as a "container." This approach to virtualization allows a single operating system to host many working configurations, with each working configuration running in isolation from the other containers and the host itself, without the bloat of a hypervisor or guest operating system. 

The following sections are pulled in from the larger docs.opscode.com site and represents the documentation that is specific to Linux containers, compiled here into a single-page reference.
